# freezer_contents

This is a small project i am making to learn more bout ruby, tho it will probs be expanded in the future <br />
i plan to add the following features: <br />
-Ability to read commands if from scripts <br />
-Ability to make modules to expand the program <br />
#Use less global vars: there is only 1 <br />
\optimise the default commands <br />
\communicate with main server to update <br />
